This app serves as an interactive encyclopedia for supernatural creatures like vampires, ghosts, and werewolves, and includes creature profiles, a quiz system, and user-favorite saving. 
The goal of this app is to both educate and entertain — it’s aimed at fans of folklore and fantasy, D&D players, and mythology nerds like myself
It includes not only lore, but also a daily featured creature and a quiz that tests your knowledge.

Features include:
- **Creature Encyclopedia**: Detailed entries for vampires, werewolves, ghosts, dragons, and fairies — including origin, powers, and more.
- **Creature of the Day**: Randomly showcases a different creature each time the app is opened.
- **Quiz System**: Multi-question quiz per creature, with randomized answers, score tracking, and results.
- **Favorites**: Mark creatures as favorites and revisit them from a dedicated screen.
- **Fully Navigable UI**: Bottom-up navigation with “Back to Home” buttons on every screen.
